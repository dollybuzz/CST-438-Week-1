Using H2 database instead of MySQL.

Add the dependency shown below to the pom.xml file.

<dependency>
<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

Edit the application.properties file. Specify the following configuration.
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:tempdb

This will use a in memory H2 database. The database is temporary and will be recreated every time the
spring server is started and deleted when the server is terminated.
To use a persistent database change the url line to
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:~/testdb
The database will create or use the existing file “testdb” in the user’s home directory. H2 runs as an
embedded database as part of the spring application. 

To access the query console for H2
• the spring server must be running.
• From a browser enter the url “localhost:8080/h2-console”.
